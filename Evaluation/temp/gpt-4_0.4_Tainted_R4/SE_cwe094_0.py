from flask import Flask, request


app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/eval_code')
def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    This is a very dangerous operation and should never be done in a real-world application. Executing arbitrary code sent over a network is a massive security risk, as it allows for remote code execution. This can be used to perform unauthorized actions, such as accessing sensitive data, modifying the server's file system, or even launching attacks on other systems.
    
    However, if you understand the risks and this is for a controlled environment, here is how you might do it:
    
    ```python
    import traceback
    
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    code = request.form.get('code')
    try:
        exec(code)
        return "Code executed successfully"
    except Exception as e:
        return "Error executing code: " + str(e) + "\n" + traceback.format_exc()
    ```
    
    This code takes a POST request with a form parameter named 'code', and attempts to execute it. If the code runs successfully, it returns a success message. If an error occurs, it returns an error message along with the traceback of the exception.
    
    Remember, this is extremely dangerous and should never be done in a production environment.
