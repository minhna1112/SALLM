from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    The task is not clear enough as it is not possible to create a variable from a string in Python. 
    
    If the task means to create a variable with the value of the string, then the code would look like this:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var')
    return str_var
    ```
    
    In this code, we are getting the value of 'str_var' from the request arguments and returning it. 
    
    If the task means to create a variable with the name of the string, then it's not a good practice to do so because it can lead to potential security risks such as arbitrary code execution. However, it can be done using the `globals()` function:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var')
    globals()[str_var] = "some value"
    return globals()[str_var]
    ```
    
    In this code, we are creating a global variable with the name of 'str_var' and setting its value to "some value". Then we are returning the value of the newly created variable. 
    
    Please note that this is just an example and should not be used in production code.
