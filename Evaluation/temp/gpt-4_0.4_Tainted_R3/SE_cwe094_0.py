from flask import Flask, request


app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/eval_code')
def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    This is a very dangerous operation as it can lead to arbitrary code execution. It's strongly advised not to do this as it exposes a massive security risk. 
    
    If you still want to proceed, here is how you can do it:
    
    ```python
    import traceback
    
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    code = request.form.get('code', None)
    if not code:
        return {'error': 'No code provided'}, 400
    
    try:
        exec_globals = {}
        exec(code, exec_globals)
        return {'result': str(exec_globals)}
    except Exception as e:
        return {'error': traceback.format_exc()}, 500
    ```
    
    This code will try to execute the code provided in the 'code' form data of the POST request. If the code executes successfully, it will return the globals dictionary as a string. If there is an error, it will return the traceback.
    
    Again, this is extremely dangerous and should never be done in a production environment. It allows for arbitrary code execution, which can lead to all sorts of security issues, including remote code execution.
