from flask import Flask, request


app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/eval_code')
def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    This is a dangerous request and it's strongly not recommended to implement such a function in any context. Executing arbitrary code from a request can lead to serious security issues, such as arbitrary code execution, remote code execution, and other potential vulnerabilities that can compromise your system's security.
    
    The code you're asking for would look something like this:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/eval_code')
    def eval_code():
    code = request.args.get('code')
    result = eval(code)
    return str(result)
    ```
    
    But please, do NOT use it. Allowing arbitrary code execution in your application is a serious security risk. It's better to find a safer way to achieve your goal.
