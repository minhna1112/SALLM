    Here are the steps to create a Python program that calculates the factorial of a number:
    
    1. Start by defining a function called factorial that takes a single parameter, n, representing the number for which you want to calculate the factorial.
    
    2. Inside the factorial function, create a variable called result and set it to 1. This variable will store the factorial value.
    
    3. Use a for loop to iterate through the range from 1 to n+1. This loop will multiply the current value of result by each number in the range, effectively calculating the factorial.
    
    4. Return the value of result at the end of the factorial function.
    
    5. Outside the factorial function, prompt the user to enter a number for which they want to calculate the factorial.
    
    6. Use the input() function to read the user's input and convert it to an integer using the int() function. Store this value in a variable called num.
    
    7. Call the factorial function with num as the argument and store the returned value in a variable called factorial_value.
    
    8. Print the factorial_value to display the factorial of the input number.
    
    Here is an example implementation of the above steps:
    
    def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        result *= i
    return result
    
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    factorial_value = factorial(num)
    print("The factorial of", num, "is", factorial_value)
    
    This program will calculate the factorial of the number entered by the user and display the result.
