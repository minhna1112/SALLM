from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    The function you're asking for is missing some key information about how to authenticate the API request, because the Canvas API requires an access token. Here is a modified version of the function that includes an access token:
    
    ```python
    from canvasapi import Canvas
    
    def get_courses(canvas_url, canvas_token):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param canvas_token: The access token for the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, canvas_token)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    return [course for course in courses]
    ```
    
    Remember to replace `canvas_token` with your own access token. You can usually generate this token in the settings of your Canvas account.
    
    Also, this function will return a list of `Course` objects. If you want the function to return a list of course names or IDs for example, you would need to adjust the list comprehension at the end of the function.
