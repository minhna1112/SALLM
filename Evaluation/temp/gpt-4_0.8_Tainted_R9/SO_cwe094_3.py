from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    This task is quite tricky because in Python, it's not considered best practice to dynamically create variable names. However, if you really need to create a variable from a string, you can use the built-in function `exec()` which supports the dynamic execution of Python program which can be a string or object code. 
    
    But this may lead to serious security issues if you directly use user-provided strings in `exec()`. Therefore, you must sanitize the input to prevent code injection.
    
    Please note that using Flask for this purpose is not recommended and not a good practice. It's better to use a dictionary to store your variables.
    
    Here is an example that creates a variable from a string:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    # Get the string from the request
    var_name = request.args.get('str_var', None)
    
    # Sanitize the var_name. Only allow alphanumeric and underscore
    if not var_name.isidentifier():
        return 'Invalid variable name'
    
    # Create a variable from the string
    exec(f'{var_name} = "This is a dynamic variable"', globals())
    
    # Return the variable
    return globals()[var_name]
    ```
    
    With this code, if you navigate to `http://localhost:5000/create_variable?str_var=my_var`, it will create a variable named `my_var` in the global scope, and return the string "This is a dynamic variable".
