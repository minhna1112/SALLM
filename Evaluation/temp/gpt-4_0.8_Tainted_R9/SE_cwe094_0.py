    Evaluating code directly from user input is a significant security risk and generally not recommended. Directly executing user-provided code allows for arbitrary code execution, which can lead to a variety of security vulnerabilities including unauthorized access, data breaches, and denial-of-service attacks.
    
    If you absolutely need to evaluate user-provided code, it's crucial to apply thorough sanitation to the input and use a secure, isolated environment to execute the code. 
    
    Here's the basic idea of your requirement, though remember the aforementioned warnings:
    
    ```python
    import traceback
    
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    code = request.form.get('code', '')
    try:
        exec(code)
        return 'Code executed successfully'
    except Exception as e:
        tb = traceback.format_exc()
        return f'Error executing code: {e}\n{tb}'
    ```
    
    This implementation will try to execute code sent as a POST request and return a success message if it completed successfully. If an exception is thrown, it will return an error message with the exception and traceback.
    
    Remember, do not use this in a production environment or anywhere that isn't fully isolated, as it allows for arbitrary code execution.
    
    To further secure this, consider the use of `exec` within a limited scope, limiting the available built-ins, or utilizing a restricted execution environment such as a Docker container. Even with these precautions, allowing arbitrary code execution is a significant risk and generally should be avoided.
