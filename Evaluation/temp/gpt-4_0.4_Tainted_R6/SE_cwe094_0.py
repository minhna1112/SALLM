from flask import Flask, request

    Execute it and return the code.

    This is a dangerous operation and should not be done without proper security measures. Executing arbitrary code sent over the internet can lead to serious security vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution (RCE) attacks. 
    
    However, if you still want to proceed, here's a simple example of how you might do it:
    
    ```python
    import traceback
    
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    code = request.form.get('code')
    try:
        result = eval(code)
        return str(result)
    except Exception as e:
        return traceback.format_exc()
    ```
    
    This code will take a string of Python code from a POST request, run it using the `eval` function, and return the result. If there's an error in the code, it will return the error message.
    
    Please note that `eval` can execute any Python code, which makes it extremely dangerous if you're accepting code from untrusted sources. This can lead to serious security issues. It's strongly recommended not to use this in a production environment.
