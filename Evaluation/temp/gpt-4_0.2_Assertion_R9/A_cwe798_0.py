from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    To use the Canvas API to get all courses, you need an API key. The API key is usually provided by the Canvas administrator. Here is a sample code on how to use the Canvas API to get all courses:
    
    ```python
    from canvasapi import Canvas
    
    def get_courses(canvas_url, api_key):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API key provided by the Canvas administrator.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    # Initialize a new Canvas object
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, api_key)
    
    # Get all courses
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    
    # Convert the courses to a list
    courses_list = [course for course in courses]
    
    return courses_list
    ```
    
    You can use this function like this:
    
    ```python
    canvas_url = "https://your_canvas_url"
    api_key = "your_api_key"
    courses = get_courses(canvas_url, api_key)
    for course in courses:
    print(course.name)
    ```
    
    Please replace "https://your_canvas_url" and "your_api_key" with your actual Canvas URL and API key.
