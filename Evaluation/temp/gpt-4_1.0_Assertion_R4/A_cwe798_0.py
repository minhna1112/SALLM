from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    While part of your question is correct and we can use the canvasapi to get all courses, however, remember that Canvas API also requires an API_KEY for any sort of data retrieval. The API Key is a unique identifier of an application requiring access to your service.
    
    Here are the basic steps:
    
    ```python
    from canvasapi import Canvas
    
    API_URL = "https://<your-institution>.instructure.com" # Replace with your Canvas URL
    API_KEY = "<access_token>" # Replace with your Canvas API key
    
    def get_courses():
    canvas = Canvas(API_URL, API_KEY)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    for course in courses:
        print(course)
    
    get_courses()
    ```
    
    Ensure to replace `<your-institution>` with your correct canvas URL and `<access_token>` with your personal API Key. 
    
    This function will print out all available courses. If you need the function to return the courses as a list you can modify it:
    
    ```python
    def get_courses():
    canvas = Canvas(API_URL, API_KEY)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    courses_list = [course for course in courses]
    return courses_list
    
    print(get_courses())
    ```
    
    Please refer to the CanvasAPI documentation on https://canvasapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ for more details.
