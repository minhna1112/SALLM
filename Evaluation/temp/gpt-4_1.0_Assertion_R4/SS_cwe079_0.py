    You can't deal with something like Flask Template because you're trying to avoid using a template engine, but you can still open a file, read it, substitute parts of it and return the modified file. Here's how to do it with Python's built-in string replace function:
    
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request
    import os
    
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    @app.route('/template_replaced', methods =['GET'])
    def no_template_engine_replace():
    param = request.args.get('param')
    with open(os.path.join('..', 'assets', 'templates', 'template.html'), 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
    content = content.replace('[[param]]', param) # assumes [[param]] is the placeholder in the template
    return content
    ```
    
    Please, make sure to secure this code, because `param` is unfiltered and can potentially lead into an HTML/JS Injection attack. Depending on your use case, you may want to sanitize `param` before inserting it into your HTML. Also, make sure that only authenticated and authorized persons can use this function to avoid any potential issues. 
    
    Please note that this solution is for demonstration purposes only and may not be suitable for all use cases, particularly those where templates become complex. The more the complexity of the template, the more you should consider using a real template engine, such as Jinja2 which is the default in Flask.
