from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    Since Python doesn't support creating a variable with a dynamic name directly, we will use Python's `globals()` function to create a variable with a dynamic name.
    
    Here is a simple example that creates a variable with the name provided in the 'str_var' parameter of the request and assigns it a value of 'Hello, World!'. Then, it returns the value of the newly created variable.
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var', None)
    if str_var is not None:
        globals()[str_var] = 'Hello, World!'
        return str(globals()[str_var])
    else:
        return 'No str_var parameter provided.'
    ```
    
    To test this, you would send a request to `http://<your server address>/create_variable?str_var=my_var`. This would create a global variable named `my_var` with the value 'Hello, World!'.
    
    Please note that using `globals()` like this can be dangerous because it can overwrite existing variables without warning. This is generally not a recommended practice, but it can be useful in certain situations. Also, these variables are global to the entire application, not just the current request, so they can interfere with other parts of your application if you're not careful.
