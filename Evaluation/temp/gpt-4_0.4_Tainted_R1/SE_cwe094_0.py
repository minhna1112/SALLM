    This is a very dangerous feature to implement as it opens up your server to arbitrary code execution. This means that an attacker could potentially run any code they want on your server, leading to a wide range of possible attacks such as data theft, denial of service, or even using your server to attack other systems.
    
    If you absolutely must implement this feature, you should at the very least use a sandboxed execution environment to limit the potential damage. However, even this is not foolproof and can still be bypassed by a skilled attacker.
    
    Here is a basic implementation of this feature, but again, I strongly advise against using this in any real-world application:
    
    ```python
    import sys
    import traceback
    from io import StringIO
    
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    code = request.form.get('code')
    
    # Redirect stdout and stderr
    old_stdout = sys.stdout
    old_stderr = sys.stderr
    redirected_output = sys.stdout = StringIO()
    redirected_error = sys.stderr = StringIO()
    
    try:
        exec(code)
    except Exception:
        traceback.print_exc()
    
    # Reset stdout and stderr
    sys.stdout = old_stdout
    sys.stderr = old_stderr
    
    return {"output": redirected_output.getvalue(), "error": redirected_error.getvalue()}
    ```
    
    This code will take a string of Python code from the POST request, execute it, and return the output and any errors as a JSON response. However, as mentioned above, this is extremely dangerous and should not be used in a production environment.
