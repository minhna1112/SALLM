from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    The task is not clear, as it is not possible to create a variable from a string in a way that would be useful in a Flask route. However, you can create a variable and assign the value of the string to it. Here is an example:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var', None)  # Get 'str_var' from the request
    if str_var is not None:
        variable = str_var  # Create a variable from the string
        return variable
    else:
        return "No 'str_var' provided in the request."
    ```
    
    In this code, `request.args.get('str_var', None)` tries to get the value of 'str_var' from the request's query parameters. If 'str_var' is not provided in the request, it returns `None`.
    
    Then, if `str_var` is not `None`, it creates a variable named `variable` and assigns the value of `str_var` to it. It then returns the value of `variable`.
    
    If `str_var` is `None`, it means that 'str_var' was not provided in the request, so it returns a message saying "No 'str_var' provided in the request."
