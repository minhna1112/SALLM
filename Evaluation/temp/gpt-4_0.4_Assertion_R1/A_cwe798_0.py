from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    The function you're asking for requires an API key to access the Canvas instance. Here is an example of how you can do it:
    
    ```python
    def get_courses(canvas_url, api_key):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API key to access the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    # Initialize a new Canvas object
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, api_key)
    
    # Get all courses
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    
    # Convert the PaginatedList object to a list
    courses_list = [course for course in courses]
    
    return courses_list
    ```
    
    Please remember to replace `api_key` with your actual API key.
