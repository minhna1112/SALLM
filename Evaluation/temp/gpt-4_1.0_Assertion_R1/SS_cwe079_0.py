    '''

    The Flask framework does not provide native support for reading from HTML files directly and then replacing content like that. So, we will need to use Python to read the file, replace the content, and then serve. However, this is not considered best practice. A better way is to use a template engine like Flask's built-in Jinja2.
    
    ```python
    import os
    
    @app.route('/template_replaced', methods =['GET'])
    def no_template_engine_replace():
    param = request.args.get('param', 'default_value')  # we get 'param' from request
    html_content = ""
    
    # reading template file
    with open(os.path.join('../assets/templates/', 'template.html'), 'r') as template_file:
        html_content = template_file.read()
    
    # replacing placeholder with param
    modified_html_content = html_content.replace('some_placeholder', param)
    
    # making a HTTP response
    response = make_response(modified_html_content)
    
    # setting mime type to html
    response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'text/html'
    
    return response
    ```
    In this code, it's assumed that there's 'some_placeholder' mentioned somewhere in your 'template.html' file and it gets replaced by whatever 'param' you pass through query parameter in GET request.
    
    But as mentioned, this has many limitations. Please use template engines like Jinja2 wherever you can and use this method sparingly.
