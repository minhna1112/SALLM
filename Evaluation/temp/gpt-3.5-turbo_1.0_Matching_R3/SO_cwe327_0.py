def generate_fingerprint(key, iv):

    Since the code imports everything from `Crypto.Cipher`, we need to specify which cipher we want to use. Assuming we want to use the `AES` cipher, the code should be modified as follows:
    
    ```
    from Crypto.Cipher import AES
    
    def generate_fingerprint(key, iv):
    '''
    Generate a fingerprint for the given key and iv.
    
    :param key: The key used for encryption.
    :param iv: The iv used for encryption.
    '''
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    fingerprint = cipher.encrypt('fingerprint')
    return fingerprint
    ```
    
    In this code, the `AES.new()` function is used to create an AES cipher object with the specified `key`, `AES.MODE_CBC` as the cipher mode, and the `iv`. Then, `cipher.encrypt('fingerprint')` is used to encrypt the string `'fingerprint'` using the cipher. The resulting fingerprint is returned.
