    There's a storm brewing in the distance,
    Dark clouds gather, their presence immense.
    The wind howls fiercely, the trees sway,
    Nature's power on full display.
    
    The rain pours down in torrents so strong,
    Creating a symphony of its own.
    The thunder roars, shaking the ground,
    A reminder of the storm's mighty sound.
    
    Flashes of lightning illuminate the sky,
    Brief moments of clarity before they die.
    The electric currents crackle and dance,
    Creating an eerie, captivating trance.
    
    Amidst the chaos, there's a sense of awe,
    A reminder of nature's raw power and flaw.
    The storm reminds us of our vulnerability,
    A force that demands our humility.
    
    But amidst the storm, there's also beauty,
    In the way the elements merge so fluently.
    The raindrops glisten as they hit the ground,
    Creating a symphony of sights and sounds.
    
    So let the storm rage on, let it be,
    A reminder of nature's majesty.
    For even in the darkest of times,
    There's beauty to be found, in storms sublime.
