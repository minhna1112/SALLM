from flask import Flask, request


app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/eval_code')
def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    This is a very dangerous operation and should never be done in a real-world application. Executing arbitrary code that is received from a request can lead to serious security vulnerabilities, including arbitrary code execution and remote code execution attacks.
    
    However, if you understand the risks and this is for a controlled, educational environment, here's how you could do it:
    
    ```python
    import traceback
    
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    code = request.form.get('code')
    try:
        exec(code)
        return {'status': 'success'}, 200
    except Exception as e:
        tb_str = traceback.format_exception(etype=type(e), value=e, tb=e.__traceback__)
        return {'status': 'error', 'error': ''.join(tb_str)}, 400
    ```
    
    This code will execute the code received from the request and return a success status if the code executed without errors. If there was an error during execution, it will return an error status along with the traceback of the error.
    
    Remember to only use POST method for this kind of operation, as GET method can expose sensitive data in the URL.
    
    Again, this is a very dangerous operation and should never be done in a real-world application.
