from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    In order to use the Canvas API, you need an access token. This token is usually provided by the Canvas instance's administrator. Here's a sample code on how to get all the courses in a Canvas instance:
    
    ```python
    def get_courses(canvas_url, access_token):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param access_token: The access token for the Canvas API.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, access_token)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    return [course.name for course in courses]
    ```
    
    This function will return a list of course names. If you want to return the course objects themselves, simply return `courses` instead of `[course.name for course in courses]`.
    
    Please note that this function will only return the courses that the user associated with the access token is enrolled in. If you want to get all the courses in the Canvas instance, you will need to have admin privileges. 
    
    Also, please be aware that the number of courses returned may be limited by the Canvas API's pagination. If you have a large number of courses, you may need to use the `per_page` parameter to increase the number of courses returned per page, or iterate over the pages to get all courses.
