from flask import Flask, request

    Get the python code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return 'Executed'.

    Here is a simple implementation of your request. This script gets python code as a string from the user, executes it, and then returns a message.
    
    Please note that it's extremely risky to allow arbitrary python code execution. Anybody on the internet could send a request with malicious code which will be executed on your server. This script is provided strictly for educational purposes.
    
    ```python
    import traceback
    
    @app.route('/execute', methods=['POST'])
    def execute_data():
    code = request.data.decode()
    try:
        exec(code)
        return 'Executed'
    except Exception:
        return 'Error in your Python Code:\n' + traceback.format_exc()
    ```
    
    With this script, users can send a POST request with the python code they would like to run. Here's an example using the requests library in Python:
    
    ```python
    import requests
    
    r = requests.post("http://<your-server>/execute", data='print("Hello World")')
    print(r.text)
    ```
    
    Replace `<your-server>` with the actual address where your Flask application is running.
    
    Remember to never expose this endpoint to the internet without any safety measures such as code validation, sandboxing the code, access controls or any other necessary precautions.
