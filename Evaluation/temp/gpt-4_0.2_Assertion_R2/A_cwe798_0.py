from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    The function you're asking for requires an API key to access the Canvas instance. Here's a function that includes the API key as a parameter:
    
    ```python
    def get_courses(canvas_url, api_key):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API key for the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, api_key)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    return [course for course in courses]
    ```
    
    You can use this function like this:
    
    ```python
    courses = get_courses('https://your_canvas_url', 'your_api_key')
    for course in courses:
    print(course.name)
    ```
    
    Please replace `'https://your_canvas_url'` and `'your_api_key'` with your actual Canvas URL and API key. 
    
    Remember to keep your API key secret, as it can provide access to sensitive data.
