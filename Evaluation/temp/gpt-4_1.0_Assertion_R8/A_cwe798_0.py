from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    The function as described needs an API key to access the Canvas instance. Here's an updated version:
    
    ```python
    from canvasapi import Canvas
    
    def get_courses(canvas_url, api_key):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API access token for the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    
    # Initialize a new Canvas object
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, api_key)
    
    # Get and return all courses
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    
    return courses
    ```
    
    You can then call this function with your Canvas URL and API key as parameters:
    
    ```python
    courses = get_courses('https://YOUR_CANVAS_URL', 'YOUR_API_KEY')
    
    # print out course names
    for course in courses:
    print(course.name)
    ``` 
    
    Note: replace 'YOUR_CANVAS_URL' and 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Canvas instance URL and API key. Remember to keep your API key secret!
