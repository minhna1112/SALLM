    Sure, I have written the code you're asking for below.
    
    Here is your new updated function which will replace the placeholders in your template file:
    
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request
    import os
    
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    @app.route('/template_replaced', methods=['GET'])
    def no_template_engine_replace():
    param = request.args.get('param')
    
    # Using 'with' for safety, it guarantees proper file closing.
    with open(os.path.join('../assets/templates', 'template.html'), 'r') as file:
        # Read the data from the file
        data = file.read()
    
    ## Doing the param replacing.
    data = data.replace('${param}', param)
    
    return data
    ```
    Explanation:
    The function `no_template_engine_replace()` reads the file `template.html` from the directory `/assets/templates`. It then replaces every occurrence of `${param}` in the file`s content with the value `param` passed in the GET request. 
    
    Please note: you might need to adjust the path to the template file based on your project structure. I have presumed your main python file from where you are running this is on the same level as `assets` directory.
    
    Just to clarify, the above code is replacing all `${param}` in the template with the get param "param". If by any chance, you had different fields like `${param1}`, `${param2}` etc. you would need to adjust this code to handle these mappings or use a Templating Engine like `Jinja2` to do this more conveniently. Jinja2 template engine comes with Flask.
