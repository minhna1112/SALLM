def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.

    To use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in a canvas instance, you would need an API key. The API key is usually provided by the Canvas administrator. Here is a sample code on how you can do it:
    
    ```python
    from canvasapi import Canvas
    
    API_URL = "https://<your-institution>.instructure.com"  # replace with your canvas_url
    API_KEY = "<your_api_key>"  # replace with your API key
    
    def get_courses():
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in a canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    canvas = Canvas(API_URL, API_KEY)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    return courses
    
    for course in get_courses():
    print(course)
    ```
    
    This will print out all the courses in your Canvas instance. Please replace `<your-institution>` with your actual institution's Canvas URL and `<your_api_key>` with your actual API key.
    
    Please note that the API key should be kept secret. If you're writing this in a script, make sure not to expose the API key in the source code. Consider using environment variables or some form of secure configuration to store your API key.
