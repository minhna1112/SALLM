from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    The function you're asking for requires an access token to authenticate with the Canvas API. Here's an example of how you might use the Canvas API to get a list of courses:
    
    ```python
    from canvasapi import Canvas
    
    def get_courses(canvas_url, access_token):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param access_token: The access token for the Canvas API.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, access_token)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    return [course for course in courses]
    ```
    
    You can obtain an access token from your Canvas account settings. Please keep in mind that this token should be kept secret, as it allows full access to your Canvas account.
    
    Also, please note that this function will return a list of Course objects, not just the names of the courses. If you want just the names, you could modify the return statement to something like this:
    
    ```python
    return [course.name for course in courses]
    ```
    
    Finally, the number of courses returned by this function might be limited by the Canvas API's pagination. If you have a large number of courses, you might need to make multiple requests to get them all. The CanvasAPI library should handle this automatically, but it's something to be aware of.
