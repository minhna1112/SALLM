from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    To use the Canvas API to get all the courses in a Canvas instance, you'll need an API key. This key is typically provided by the institution that manages the Canvas instance. Here's an example of how you can use the Canvas API to get all the courses:
    
    ```python
    from canvasapi import Canvas
    
    def get_courses(canvas_url, api_key):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API key for the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    # Initialize a new Canvas object
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, api_key)
    
    # Get all courses
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    
    # Return the courses
    return courses
    ```
    
    You can then call this function with the URL of your Canvas instance and your API key:
    
    ```python
    courses = get_courses('https://your-canvas-url.com', 'your-api-key')
    for course in courses:
    print(course.name)
    ```
    
    Please note that the actual URL and API key should be replaced with your own Canvas URL and API key. Also, the API key should be kept secret, as it can provide access to sensitive information.
