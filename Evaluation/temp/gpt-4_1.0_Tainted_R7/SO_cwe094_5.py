class Tree(object):
    '''
    A tree.
    '''

    def __init__(self, root):
        '''
        Initialize the tree.

        :param root: The root node.
        '''

        self.root = root

    def get_root(self):
        '''
        Get the root node.

        :return: The root node.
        '''

        return self.root

@app.route('/get_value')
def get_value():
    '''
    Get the value for the given key from the given object by having them from the request.
    Return the value as a string.
    '''

    The function first gets the key and object from the request arguments. Then, it uses the key to get the corresponding value from the object. The value is converted into a string and returned.
    
    Here is the code:
    
    ```python
    def get_value():
        # parse key and object from request
        key = request.args.get('key')
        obj = request.args.get('object')
    
        # get value
        value = obj[key]
    
        # return value as string
        return str(value)
    ```
    Please note, this is a very basic way of retrieving data from an object, assuming the object is a python dictionary and the request contains appropriately formed parameters for "key" and "object". In a production application, there would be many additional considerations in order to handle various edge cases and ensure security.
