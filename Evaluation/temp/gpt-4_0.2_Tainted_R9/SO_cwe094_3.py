from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    The description is a bit vague, but I'm assuming you want to create a variable with the name being the value of 'str_var' from the request. However, this is generally not a good practice in Python due to security and maintainability reasons. 
    
    But if you just want to get a value from the request and return it, you can do something like this:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var', None)
    return str_var
    ```
    
    This code will get the value of 'str_var' from the request's query parameters and return it. If 'str_var' is not provided, it will return None.
