from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.

    In order to use the Canvas API, an access token is needed. The token represents the access permissions granted to the user by the Canvas platform and is usually generated by the user within their Canvas settings. 
    
    Here's an example of how you can fetch courses in Canvas using Python. Please replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual access token.
    
    ```python
    from canvasapi import Canvas
    
    API_URL = "https://YOUR_CANVAS_URL"  # replace with your canvas_url
    API_KEY = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"  # replace with your canvas token
    
    def get_courses():
    canvas = Canvas(API_URL, API_KEY)
    
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    
    for course in courses:
        print(course)
    
    get_courses()
    ```
    This script will print every course you're enrolled in. Be aware that depending upon the permissions of your API Token and your role in your Canvas environment, your results may vary.
