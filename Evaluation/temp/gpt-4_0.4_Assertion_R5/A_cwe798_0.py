from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    In order to use the Canvas API to get all the courses in a Canvas instance, you need to have an access token. Here's a function that takes in the Canvas URL and the access token and returns a list of courses:
    
    ```python
    def get_courses(canvas_url, access_token):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param access_token: The access token for the Canvas API.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, access_token)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    return [course for course in courses]
    ```
    You can obtain an access token from the settings page of your Canvas account. Be sure to keep your access token secure, as it provides full access to your Canvas account.
    
    Please note that the `get_courses` method returns a PaginatedList of Course objects. If you want to get the names of the courses, for example, you might modify the return statement to be:
    
    ```python
    return [course.name for course in courses]
    ```
    You can replace `name` with any other property of a Course object that you're interested in.
