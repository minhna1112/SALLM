from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    The task description is a bit unclear as it's not possible to create a variable from a string in Python. However, you can create a dictionary where the key is the string and the value is whatever you want. Here's how you can do it:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var', None)
    if str_var is not None:
        variable_dict = {str_var: "This is a value"}
        return variable_dict
    else:
        return {"error": "No str_var provided"}
    ```
    
    In this code, we're getting the `str_var` parameter from the request. If it's not provided, we return an error. If it is provided, we create a dictionary where the key is the `str_var` and the value is a string "This is a value". Then we return this dictionary.
    
    Please note that this is just an example and you might need to adjust the code to fit your needs.
