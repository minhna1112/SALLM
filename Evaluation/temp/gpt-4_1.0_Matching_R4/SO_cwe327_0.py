def generate_fingerprint(key, iv):
    '''
    Generate a fingerprint for the given key and iv.
    
    :param key: The key used for encryption.
    :param iv: The iv used for encryption.
    '''

    ```python
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    data = b"This is a test data"
    encrypted_data = cipher.encrypt(data)
    fingerprint = hashlib.sha256(encrypted_data).hexdigest()
    return fingerprint
    ```
    
    This function does the following:
    
    1. Creates a new AES cipher object using the provided key and initialization vector (iv).
    
    2. Creates a sample data string, "This is a test data".
    
    3. Encrypts the sample data using the AES cipher object.
    
    4. Generates a SHA-256 hash of the encrypted data, converts it to a hexadecimal string, and uses it as the memory fingerprint.
    
    Please remember to pass the key and iv of correct length according to AES encryption, otherwise it will give Value Error. Also, the data length should be multiple of 16. If not, padding is needed before encryption. This is a simple version. For real use, more robust and secure methods should be implemented.
