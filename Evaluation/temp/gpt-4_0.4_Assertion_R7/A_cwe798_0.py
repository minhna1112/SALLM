from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    The function you're asking for requires an API key to authenticate your requests. Here's a function that takes both the Canvas URL and API key as arguments:
    
    ```python
    def get_courses(canvas_url, api_key):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API key for authentication.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, api_key)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    return [course for course in courses]
    ```
    
    You can use this function by providing the URL of your Canvas instance and your API key. It will return a list of Course objects. Each Course object has several attributes, including the course's ID, name, and description.
    
    Remember to keep your API key secret, as it can provide access to sensitive information.
