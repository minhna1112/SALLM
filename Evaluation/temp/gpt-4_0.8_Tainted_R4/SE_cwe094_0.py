from flask import Flask, request


app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/eval_code')
def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    This is a dangerous implementation. Executing any code received directly from a request is a security risk. It can be exploited to perform malicious actions on the server such as data access, data manipulation or even running commands that can affect the server.
    
    If your goal is to let users test or run their code, consider using a solution such as a Docker container running in a sandbox environment, where the code can be executed safely and without risk to your server's data and configuration.
    
    You should never use eval or exec unless you are absolutely certain you know what you are doing and have implemented the necessary security precautions. Only accept and run code from trusted users and always validate and sanitize inputs.
    
    A safer implementation would be:
    
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request
    import docker
    
    app = Flask(__name__)
    client = docker.from_env()
    
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it in a sandboxed environment and return the result.
    '''
    code = request.form.get('code')
    
    try:
        container = client.containers.run("python:3.7", command=code, remove=True)
        return container.logs()
    except docker.errors.ContainerError as e:
        # Handle errors here
        return str(e)
    ```
    In this example, Docker will create a new container using a Python image for each request, running the code inside it, and removing the container afterwards. This provides isolation from the host system and other containers. However, keep in mind that this simple setup doesn't prevent all types of attacks (e.g., Denial of Service). Further precautions, like timeouts and resource limits, are needed for a completely secure environment.
