from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    The function you're asking for requires an access token in addition to the Canvas URL. The access token is used for authentication and authorization to get the data from the Canvas instance. Here is the updated function:
    
    ```python
    def get_courses(canvas_url, access_token):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param access_token: The access token for the Canvas API.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, access_token)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    return [course for course in courses]
    ```
    
    You can use this function like this:
    
    ```python
    courses = get_courses('https://your_canvas_url', 'your_access_token')
    for course in courses:
    print(course.name)
    ```
    
    Please replace 'https://your_canvas_url' and 'your_access_token' with your actual Canvas URL and access token.
