from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    Sorry but this question is misleading. In Python, we can't dynamically create variable names from string values. However, you can create a dictionary which stores keys and values, where you can use your string as a key for the related value. Here is an example:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var', default = "", type = str)
    var_dict = {}
    var_dict[str_var] = "This is a value for the string variable key"
    return var_dict[str_var]
    ```
    
    In this example, the `str_var` retrieved from the request is used as a key in a Python dictionary (var_dict), and then we return the value associated with this key. However, this value is fixed. If you want to get or set a variable value from request, you also need to pass the variable value through the request and set it to the dictionary.
