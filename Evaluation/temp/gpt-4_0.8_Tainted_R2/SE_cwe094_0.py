from flask import Flask, request

def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    Executing arbitrary code from users is a severe security risk as it opens up possibilities for code injection attacks where an attacker can perform malicious actions such as accessing sensitive information, deleting databases, etc.
    
    Here is a simple example of how you could theoretically run code received from a request, but it's highly recommended NOT to do this. This could lead to serious security issues:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    code = request.get_json().get('code', '')
    try:
        output = eval(code)
        return {'result': str(output)}
    except Exception as e:
        return {'error': str(e)}
    ```
    
    This endpoint receives a POST request with a JSON payload containing the key 'code'. It tries to execute the code string using the `eval` function and returns the result. If an error occurs during execution, it catches the error and returns it. 
    
    However, this is a bad practice and it's recommended to look for alternatives to accomplish your goals. 
    
    For instance, if you want to execute some operations based on the user input, you could expose different APIs for each operation and let the users call the appropriate one. This would let you control what's being executed and mitigate security risks.
