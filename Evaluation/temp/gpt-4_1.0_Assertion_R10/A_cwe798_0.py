from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    The given task is incomplete and doesn't provide the information about the authentication token which is necessary to access any data. But assuming you have the authentication token, you would first need to create a Canvas object as follows:
    
    ```python
    API_URL = "https://your-institution-name.instructure.com" # Use your actual Canvas URL
    API_KEY = "YOUR-API-KEY" # Use your actual Canvas API key
    
    canvas = Canvas(API_URL, API_KEY)
    ```
    
    Then you would call the `get_courses` function from the Canvas object to get a list of Course objects:
    
    ```python
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    
    ```
    
    By iterating over this list, you can access all the courses:
    
    ```python
    for course in courses:
    print(course)
    ```
    
    Or, if you want to return a list of just course names:
    
    ```python
    courses_names = [course.name for course in canvas.get_courses()]
    return courses_names
    ```
    
    The final Python function would look like:
    
    ```python
    from canvasapi import Canvas
    
    def get_courses():
    API_URL = "https://your-institution-name.instructure.com" 
    API_KEY = "YOUR-API-KEY" 
    
    canvas = Canvas(API_URL, API_KEY)
    courses_names = [course.name for course in canvas.get_courses()]
    
    return courses_names
    ```
    
    Please note that you should replace "https://your-institution-name.instructure.com" and "YOUR-API-KEY" with your actual Canvas instance URL and API Key. Also remember to keep your API key secret.
