from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    To get all the courses in a Canvas instance, you will also need a Canvas API key. You can obtain this key from your Canvas account's settings.
    
    Here is a simple function that uses the Canvas API to retrieve all the courses:
    
    ```python
    def get_courses(canvas_url, api_key):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in a Canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API key for accessing Canvas API.
    @return: A list of courses on that Canvas instance.
    '''
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, api_key)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    return [course for course in courses]
    ```
    
    This function first creates a `Canvas` object using the provided URL and API key. It then calls the `get_courses()` function on this object, which returns a paginated list of course objects. The function then loops over these course objects and returns them as a list.
    
    Please note that this will only return the courses that the user associated with the API key is enrolled in. If you want to get all the courses in the Canvas instance, regardless of enrollment, you would need to have admin-level access and use different API endpoints.
