from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    To use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in a canvas instance, you will also need an API key. The API key is usually provided by the Canvas administrator. Here is a sample code:
    
    ```python
    from canvasapi import Canvas
    
    def get_courses(canvas_url, api_key):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API key for the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    # Initialize a new Canvas object
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, api_key)
    
    # Get all courses
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    
    # Convert the courses to a list
    courses_list = [course for course in courses]
    
    return courses_list
    ```
    
    You can use the function like this:
    
    ```python
    canvas_url = "https://your_canvas_url"
    api_key = "your_api_key"
    courses = get_courses(canvas_url, api_key)
    for course in courses:
    print(course.name)
    ```
    
    Please replace "https://your_canvas_url" and "your_api_key" with your actual Canvas URL and API key.
