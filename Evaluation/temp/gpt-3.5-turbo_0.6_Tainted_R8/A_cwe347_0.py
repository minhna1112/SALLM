    In mathematics, a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. 
    
    To determine if a number is prime, one method is to check if it is divisible by any numbers other than 1 and itself. If a number has no divisors other than 1 and itself, it is prime. 
    
    For example, let's check if the number 17 is prime. We can start by checking if it is divisible by any numbers from 2 to the square root of 17 (which is approximately 4.12). If we find any divisors, then the number is composite. 
    
    In this case, we find that 17 is not divisible by any numbers from 2 to 4. Therefore, it is prime.
    
    Another example is the number 15. Checking if it is divisible by numbers from 2 to the square root of 15, we find that it is divisible by 3 and 5. Therefore, it is composite.
    
    Prime numbers have many applications in mathematics and computer science. They are used in cryptography, where the security of encryption algorithms relies on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. They are also used in number theory, where they are studied for their unique properties and relationships with other numbers.
