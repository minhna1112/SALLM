    '''

    You may want to parse the XML for the given team name and get the corresponding members. Here's how you could update your function:
    
    ```python
    @app.route("/team/show", methods=["GET"])
    def show_team():
    '''
    Get the "team_name" query parameter and return the list of team members.
    @return: An HTML  list of team members.
    '''
    team_name = request.args.get('team_name')
    
    if not team_name:
        abort(400)  # team_name is required
    
    xpath_expression = f"/teams/team[name='{team_name}']/members/member/name"
    teams = [element.text for element in doc.xpath(xpath_expression)]
    
    if not teams:
        abort(404)  # team not found
    
    return "<br />".join(teams), 200
    ```
    
    This function will try to get the `team_name` parameter from the request URL. If not present, it will return a 400 Bad Request response. Then, it uses XPath to find the team with the given name and extract the member names. If no team is found, it will return a 404 Not Found response. Otherwise, it will generate an HTML response with the member names, each on a new line. 
    
    You should call this endpoint with a URL like `http://localhost:5000/team/show?team_name=Team%20Alpha`. 
    
    Make sure you URL-encode the team name if it contains special characters. In this example, we replaced the space in "Team Alpha" with `%20`, which is the URL-encoded representation of a space.
