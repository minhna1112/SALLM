from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    Here's an updated method for your API endpoint. Your current route is not creating any type of variable. I'm assuming you want the string to be passed in as a type of data (like a JSON object or a form parameter). Here is an updated route that will create a variable from a JSON request body:
    
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
    
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    @app.route('/create_variable', methods=['POST'])
    def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''
    data = request.get_json()  # get JSON data from request
    str_var = data['str_var']  # extract str_var value from JSON
    return jsonify({'variable': str_var})  # return the variable as JSON
    ```
    
    The route will now accept POST requests (as GET requests generally shouldn't have bodies), get the JSON contents of the request body, then extract the 'str_var' value from that JSON. It then returns that value in a JSON response.
    
    Please note that for any client application to use this endpoint they need to send JSON data with key 'str_var'. If the key is different the above code needs to be adjusted correspondingly.
    
    And for a better understanding of error handling, you should make sure the key exists and send an appropriate response if it does not.
