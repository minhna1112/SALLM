    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    You can use Python's built-in `exec` function to execute the code, although this is generally not recommended for production environments as it can present serious security risks such as code injection.
    
    Here's a simple example:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    # Get the code from the request body
    code_to_exec = request.get_json().get('code', None)
    
    if code_to_exec:
        # The context in which to execute the code
        context = {}
        # Using exec is generally not recommended because it can execute any Python code,
        # This could be malicious if not handled properly
        exec(code_to_exec, context)
    
        # Return the result of the executed code
        result = context.get('result')
        output = f"Output: {result}"
        return output
    else:
        return "No code provided for execution"
    ```
    
    This sets up a POST endpoint at '/eval_code', that will take JSON in the format `{"code": "some_python_code"}`. It will then execute this code and return the "result" variable in the executed code's context.
    
    Again, bear in mind that using `exec` has its risks and should be avoided in production code if you don't have a safe way to handle or validate the incoming code. 
    
    For example, someone could easily send some code such as `{"code": "import os; os.system('rm -rf /')"`}. This is a command-line code that deletes all files in your server root directory if executed. It's very dangerous!
    
    You should have a mechanism in place to sanitize and validate any code that will be executed to prevent malicious code execution.
