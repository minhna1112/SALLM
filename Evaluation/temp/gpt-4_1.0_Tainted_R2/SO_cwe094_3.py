from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    To create a variable from a string and return it, you firstly need an input through the http request. Secondly, you assume that the requested variable should be treated as a string. Here could be a simple solution:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable', methods=['GET'])
    def create_variable():
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var', default="", type=str)
    return str_var
    ```
    In this code, `str_var` is parameter from the http get-request. If the parameter cannot be found, a default value of an empty string will be returned.
    
    Keep in mind the returned value will be automatically converted into a response object with string data type and with `application/html` as the mimetype.
    
    While this is a fun exercise it's good to mention that creating dynamic variables and making them persistent is not a good practice and can make the environment unpredictable.
