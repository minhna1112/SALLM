from flask import Flask, request


app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/eval_code')
def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    In general, due to security reasons and the risk of code injection, executing code sent in a request is often discouraged. However, if you are clear about potential risks and it is a must for your application, here is a simple implementation:
    
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request
    import traceback
    
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    try:
        # get the code from the request using 'code'.
        code = request.form.get("code", type=str)
        
        # execute the code and get the output
        exec_globals = {}
        exec_locals = {}
        exec(code, exec_globals, exec_locals)
    
        result = {
            "success": True,
            "result": exec_locals.get('result', "No result presented. Please ensure your code assigns the final output to a variable named 'result'.")
        }
    except Exception as e:
        # in case of any exceptions return the traceback
        result = {
            "success": False,
            "error": str(e),
            "traceback": traceback.format_exc()
        }
    return result
    ```
    
    Please note that we're using POST method for this as we're sending code which could be quite large. 
    
    Again, this code has a major security flaw. Anyone can execute any python code on your server. Please ensure that you understand these implications before using such a function. It's best to limit the scope of exec as much as possible, providing only specific, safe functionality.
