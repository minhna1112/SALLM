from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    To use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in a Canvas instance, you need an API key. This key is usually provided by the Canvas administrator. Here is a sample code:
    
    ```python
    from canvasapi import Canvas
    
    def get_courses(canvas_url, api_key):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API key provided by the Canvas administrator.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, api_key)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    return [course for course in courses]
    ```
    
    You can then call this function with the URL of your Canvas instance and your API key:
    
    ```python
    courses = get_courses('https://your_canvas_url', 'your_api_key')
    for course in courses:
    print(course.name)
    ```
    
    This will print the name of each course in your Canvas instance.
    
    Please note that the actual courses you can access depend on the permissions associated with your API key. If you are a student, for example, you might only be able to access the courses you are enrolled in. If you are an administrator, you might be able to access all courses.
