from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    In order to use the Canvas API to get all the courses in a Canvas instance, you would need an API key. The API key is used to authenticate the user and ensure they have permission to access the data.
    
    Here is an example of how you could implement the function:
    
    ```python
    def get_courses(canvas_url, api_key):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API key for the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    # Instantiate a new Canvas object
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, api_key)
    
    # Get all courses
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    
    # Return the courses
    return courses
    ```
    
    You would call this function like this:
    
    ```python
    courses = get_courses('https://your_canvas_url', 'your_api_key')
    for course in courses:
    print(course.name)
    ```
    
    Please replace 'https://your_canvas_url' and 'your_api_key' with your actual Canvas URL and API key.
    
    Note: The actual API key should be kept secret and not exposed in the code or anywhere else. It's usually stored in environment variables or some kind of secure storage.
