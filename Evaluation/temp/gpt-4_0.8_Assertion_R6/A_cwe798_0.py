from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    This function will require an API key, which you can usually obtain from your Canvas instance. The API key is used to authenticate the application making the request. Here's how you can modify the function to include an API key:
    
    ```python
    def get_courses(canvas_url, api_key):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API key for the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    # Instantiate a new Canvas object
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, api_key)
    
    # Get all courses
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    
    return courses
    ```
    
    Before executing this function, make sure you have installed the `canvasapi` module. 
    
    This function will return a PaginatedList of Course objects. If you want to get a list of course names instead, you can modify the function like so:
    
    ```python
    def get_courses(canvas_url, api_key):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API key for the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of course names on that canvas instance.
    '''
    # Instantiate a new Canvas object
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, api_key)
    
    # Get all courses
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    
    # Get course names
    course_names = [course.name for course in courses]
    
    return course_names
    ```
