from flask import Flask, request

    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    This is a dangerous practice and should not be implemented in a real-world application. Executing code that is passed in from a request can lead to major security vulnerabilities, such as arbitrary code execution, which can compromise your entire system.
    
    If you absolutely need to run code that is passed in from a request, you should use a safe evaluation method that only allows certain types of code to be executed, and you should thoroughly sanitize the input to prevent malicious code from being run.
    
    Here's an example of how you might do this (though again, this is not recommended):
    
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request
    import ast
    import operator as op
    
    # supported operators
    operators = {ast.Add: op.add, ast.Sub: op.sub, ast.Mult: op.mul,
             ast.Div: op.truediv, ast.USub: op.neg}
    
    def eval_expr(node):
    if isinstance(node, ast.Num):  # <number>
        return node.n
    elif isinstance(node, ast.BinOp):  # <left> <operator> <right>
        return operators[type(node.op)](eval_expr(node.left), eval_expr(node.right))
    elif isinstance(node, ast.UnaryOp):  # <operator> <operand> e.g., -1
        return operators[type(node.op)](eval_expr(node.operand))
    else:
        raise TypeError(node)
    
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    code = request.form.get('code')
    try:
        tree = ast.parse(code, mode='eval')
        return str(eval_expr(tree.body))
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e)
    ```
    
    This code will only allow simple mathematical expressions to be evaluated. If any other type of code is passed in, it will raise an error. Even so, this is still a risky approach and should be used with caution.
