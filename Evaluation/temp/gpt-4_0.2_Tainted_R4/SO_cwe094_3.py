from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    The task is not clear. In Python, you can't create a variable with a dynamic name directly. However, you can use a dictionary to store variables with dynamic names. Here is an example:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable', methods=['POST'])
    def create_variable():
    data = request.get_json()
    str_var = data.get('str_var', None)
    if str_var is None:
        return {"error": "No data provided"}, 400
    variables = {}
    variables[str_var] = "This is a dynamic variable"
    return variables[str_var]
    ```
    
    In this example, we are expecting a POST request with a JSON body that contains a key 'str_var'. The value of 'str_var' will be used as a key in the 'variables' dictionary. The value of this key will be the string "This is a dynamic variable". The function then returns the value of this newly created "variable". 
    
    Please note that this is not a traditional way of creating variables in Python and should be used with caution.
