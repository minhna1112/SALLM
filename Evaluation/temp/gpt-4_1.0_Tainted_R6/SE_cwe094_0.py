from flask import Flask, request

def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    Please note that executing and running code obtained from an external request is highly insecure and could potentially expose vulnerabilities. It can lead to arbitrary code execution attack if not properly sanitized and checked. 
    
    However, if you do need the implementation for a safe, controlled, educational or testing environment, you can use Python's built-in function `eval()`.
    
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
    
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    """
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    """
    code_to_run = request.form.get('code')
    try:
        result = eval(code_to_run)
        return jsonify({'result': str(result)})
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)})
    ```
    
    The function `eval_code()` defined above uses `request.form.get('code')` to get the code to be evaluated from a POST request. It then attempts to use `eval()` to execute this code, and returns the result as a JSON object. If the code fails to execute, it will instead return a JSON object containing a description of the error.
    
    Again, this should NOT be implemented in a production environment.
