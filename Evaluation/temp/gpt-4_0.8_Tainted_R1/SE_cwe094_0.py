from flask import Flask, request

    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    This is not a recommended or safe way of dealing with code execution as it may introduce serious security vulnerabilities into your application. Executing arbitrary code from a request can lead to remote code execution which is a serious security breach. 
    
    Moreover, if you're hosting your application on a shared server, this could lead to other applications on the same server getting compromised too. 
    
    If you want to create an application to run code, consider using services like Docker to isolate each run in its own container. Take a look at platforms like Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or Visual Studio Code's online editor, which have safe execution of foreign code figured out.
    
    However, if you understand the risks and still want to go ahead, here is a way you could potentially handle this:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    """
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    """
    
    code = request.form.get('code')
    try:
        result = eval(code)
    except Exception as e:
        return {'result': str(e)}, 400
    
    return {'result': str(result)}, 200
    ```
    
    Remember, use this at your own risk. It's highly advised to not use `eval` or `exec` with untrusted inputs.
