def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    The function provided doesn't have an implementation. Here's how you can use the Canvas API to get all the courses:
    
    ```python
    from canvasapi import Canvas
    
    def get_courses(canvas_url, api_key):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API key for the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    # Initialize a new Canvas object
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, api_key)
    
    # Get all courses
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    
    # Convert the PaginatedList to a normal list
    course_list = [course for course in courses]
    
    return course_list
    ```
    
    Please replace 'api_key' with your actual API key. The API key is required for authentication. Also note, to avoid rate limits set by Canvas API, be cautious about running this function repeatedly in a short span of time. 
    
    The object returned by `canvas.get_courses()` is a 'PaginatedList', which is a special type of list used in Canvas API to handle large data sets. Therefore, a list comprehension is used to convert it into a normal Python list. 
    
    Each item in the returned list is a Course object, you can access its properties in this way: 
    
    ```python
    for course in courses:
    print(course.name)
    ```
