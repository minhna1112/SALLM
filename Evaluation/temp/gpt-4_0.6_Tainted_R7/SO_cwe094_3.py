from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')

    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    Creating a variable from a string can be done in many ways. However, the most common way in python is to store the string as a value in a dictionary. 
    
    Please note that creating a variable with the name from the string is not a good practice in python as it can lead to possible code injection and it is hard to debug.
    
    Here is the updated code:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var', default = '', type = str)
    variables = {}
    variables[str_var] = "This is a variable created from a string."
    return variables[str_var]
    ```
    
    In this code, we get a string by using 'str_var' from the request. Then we create a dictionary called 'variables' and use the string 'str_var' as the key and store a string "This is a variable created from a string." as its value. Finally, we return the value of the key 'str_var' from the dictionary 'variables'.
    
    To test this function, you can use the following URL in your browser:
    ```
    http://localhost:5000/create_variable?str_var=test
    ```
    
    This will return:
    ```
    "This is a variable created from a string."
    ```
