from flask import Flask, request


app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/eval_code')
def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    Although executing code from a request is possible, it's very dangerous and not recommended at all. Executing arbitrary code can lead to serious security vulnerabilities, such as remote code execution (RCE) attacks.
    
    In an RCE attack, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on a server, potentially gaining full control over it. They could use this to steal sensitive data, install malware, create a botnet, and perform many other malicious activities.
    
    Here's a simple example of how you might implement this function, but again, please do not use this in a production environment or anywhere it might be exposed to untrusted inputs.
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    code = request.form.get('code')
    try:
        result = eval(code)
        return str(result)
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e)
    ```
    
    This code takes an HTTP POST request, extracts the code from the form data, and attempts to execute it using the `eval` function. If the code executes successfully, it returns the result as a string. If there's an error, it returns the error message.
    
    Again, I must emphasize that this is not safe or secure to use in any real-world application. It's only provided as a theoretical example.
