from flask import Flask, request

def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    This is a very dangerous operation and it's strongly recommended not to do this. Executing arbitrary code that is sent over the internet can lead to serious security vulnerabilities, such as code injection attacks. 
    
    If you absolutely must do this, you should at least make sure to sanitize the input and limit the operations that can be performed. However, even with these precautions, it's still a risky operation and should be avoided if possible.
    
    Here is an example of how you might do this, but again, it's strongly recommended not to do this:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    code = request.form.get('code')
    try:
        result = eval(code)
        return str(result)
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e)
    ```
    
    This code takes a POST request with a form parameter named 'code', attempts to execute it using the `eval` function, and returns the result as a string. If an error occurs during execution, it returns the error message.
    
    Again, this is a very dangerous operation and should be avoided if possible.
