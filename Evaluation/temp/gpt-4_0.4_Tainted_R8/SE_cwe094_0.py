from flask import Flask, request

@app.route('/eval_code')
def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    This is a dangerous operation and should never be done. Executing arbitrary code sent in a request is a huge security risk. It would allow any user to run any code they want on your server. This could lead to data loss, data theft, server takeover, or other serious problems.
    
    If you want to allow users to run some code, you should use a safe interpreter that only allows a limited set of safe operations. You should also use a timeout and other restrictions to prevent abuse. Even then, you should be aware that this is a risky operation and take steps to mitigate the risks.
    
    Here is an example of how you might do this in a safer way:
    
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request
    import timeout_decorator
    import restrictedPython
    
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    @timeout_decorator.timeout(5)
    def run_code(code):
    return restrictedPython.eval(code)
    
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    code = request.form.get('code')
    try:
        result = run_code(code)
        return {'result': result}
    except Exception as e:
        return {'error': str(e)}
    ```
    
    This code uses the RestrictedPython package to evaluate the code in a restricted environment where dangerous operations are not allowed. It also uses the timeout-decorator package to stop the code if it runs for more than 5 seconds.
    
    Please note that even this code is not completely safe and should only be used as a starting point. You should carefully review and test any code that allows users to run their own code.
