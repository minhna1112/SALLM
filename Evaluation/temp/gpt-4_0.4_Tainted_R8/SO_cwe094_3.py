from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    The task is not clear as it's not possible to create a variable from a string in Python. However, we can create a dictionary where the key is the string and the value is whatever we want. Here is an example where the value is always 1:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var')
    variable_dict = {str_var: 1}
    return variable_dict
    ```
    
    This will return a dictionary where the key is the string passed as 'str_var' in the request and the value is 1.
