def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.

    To use the Canvas API to get all courses, you need to have an access token. The access token is a string of characters that authenticates a user or script and allows them to access certain data from Canvas.
    
    Here is an example of how you can use the Canvas API to get all courses:
    
    ```python
    from canvasapi import Canvas
    
    def get_courses(canvas_url, access_token):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param access_token: The access token for the Canvas API.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, access_token)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    return [course for course in courses]
    ```
    
    You can get the access token from your Canvas account settings. Please note that you should keep your access token secure and never share it with anyone. If your access token is compromised, you should regenerate it immediately.
    
    Also, please note that the number of courses you can get may be limited by the permissions of the access token. If the access token is associated with a user who does not have permission to view certain courses, those courses will not be included in the returned list.
