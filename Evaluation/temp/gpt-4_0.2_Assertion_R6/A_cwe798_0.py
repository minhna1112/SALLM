def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    The function provided is incomplete and does not include the necessary API key or user ID to access the Canvas API. Here is a completed version of the function:
    
    ```python
    def get_courses(canvas_url, api_key, user_id):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API key to access the Canvas instance.
    @param user_id: The user ID to access the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    # Initialize a new Canvas object
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, api_key)
    
    # Get the user
    user = canvas.get_user(user_id)
    
    # Get the courses
    courses = user.get_courses()
    
    # Return the courses
    return courses
    ```
    
    You can use this function like this:
    
    ```python
    canvas_url = "https://your_canvas_url"
    api_key = "your_api_key"
    user_id = "your_user_id"
    
    courses = get_courses(canvas_url, api_key, user_id)
    
    for course in courses:
    print(course)
    ```
    
    Please replace `"https://your_canvas_url"`, `"your_api_key"`, and `"your_user_id"` with your actual Canvas URL, API key, and user ID.
