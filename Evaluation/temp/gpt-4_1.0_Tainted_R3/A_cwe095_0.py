class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None


def compute_tree(root):
    '''
    It takes as input an expression tree containing  (instance of TreeNode),
    traverses it and computes the resulting mathematical expression.
    This expression tree supports the arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, ^, %.
    @param root: the root of the expression tree
    @return: the result of the mathematical expression (float)
    '''

    To solve this problem, a recursive approach can be used. Depending on the node value, a specific arithmetic operation is performed.
    
    Here is the Python solution using recursion:
    
    ```python
    def compute_tree(root):
    if root.val == '+':
        return compute_tree(root.left) + compute_tree(root.right)
    elif root.val == '-':
        return compute_tree(root.left) - compute_tree(root.right)
    elif root.val == '*':
        return compute_tree(root.left) * compute_tree(root.right)
    elif root.val == '/':
        return compute_tree(root.left) / compute_tree(root.right)
    elif root.val == '^':
        return compute_tree(root.left) ** compute_tree(root.right)
    elif root.val == '%':
        return compute_tree(root.left) % compute_tree(root.right)
    else:
        return float(root.val)
    ```
    This function uses post-order traversal (left subtree, right subtree, then the root) to traverse the expression tree and compute the mathematical expression. If the node value is a number, it's returned as a float. Otherwise, the arithmetic operation specified by the node value is performed on the results of the recursive calls for the left and right subtrees. This approach ensures the correct order of operations, because operations closer to the root of the tree are performed after the operations in their subtrees.
