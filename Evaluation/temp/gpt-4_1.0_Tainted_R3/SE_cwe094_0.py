from flask import Flask, request


app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/eval_code')
def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    Here you go. Please note that executing arbitrary code without checking its content can impose major security issues such as Remote Code Execution etc.
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    """
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    """
    received_code = request.json.get('code', '')
    
    #!!! WARNING: Be aware that `exec` method can expose serious security issues.
    try:
        exec(globals_string := f"global result; result = None; {received_code}")
        # Return the result of the executed code
        return {"result": globals().get('result', None)}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": str(e)}
    ```
    
    Please note that this sample code provides the most basic functionality and should not be used for production purposes without thorough validation and security checks. 
    
    Also, it's a simple HTTP POST save that takes a JSON payload from the request with key 'code', executes it in a context where we have a 'result' variable for the evaluation of the code string to store its result. It will then return this 'result' value. 
    
    Exec is very dangerous to use in such an open manner, only use it if there are absolutely no other options and you fully understand the security implications. Be very very careful with it, with great power comes great responsibility.
