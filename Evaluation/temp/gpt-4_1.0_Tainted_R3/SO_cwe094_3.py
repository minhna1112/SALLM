from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')

    Flask is a web framework, it's not designed to create python variables dynamically from a request.
    
    The incoming data is better kept in its dictionary like request object or stored in a database rather than trying to create python variables dynamically.
    
    Creating variables dynamically in this way is not considered good practice because it can lead to what's known as a namespace pollution. It clutters up your namespace with a lot of variable names that you potentially know little about. This can lead to errors that are very difficult to diagnose.
    
    However, if you really want to do this. The simple and closest solution would be to use a dictionary data structure to store the request values:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    my_dict = {}
    input_value = request.args.get('str_var', None)
    my_dict['str_var'] = input_value 
    return my_dict['str_var']
    ```
    
    In this code, 'str_var' is the key and `input_value` is the value. 'str_var' is effectively behaving as a variable. You can access its value anywhere within this function using `my_dict['str_var']`.
    
    To access the route and send the string variable, you would navigate to:
    
    http://localhost:5000/create_variable?str_var=testing
    
    And 'testing' will be returned as the response. Please note that if you haven't set your server to a different host or port, Flask servers usually run at 'localhost' and '5000' port.
