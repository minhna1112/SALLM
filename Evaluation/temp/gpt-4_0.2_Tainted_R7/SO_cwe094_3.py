from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    This task is not possible in Python. Python does not support creating variable names dynamically from strings in a safe manner. 
    
    However, you can use a dictionary to store values with string keys which can mimic the behavior of variables. Here is an example:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var', None)
    if str_var is not None:
        variables = {}
        variables[str_var] = "This is your variable"
        return variables[str_var]
    else:
        return "No variable name provided in the request"
    ```
    
    In this example, `variables` is a dictionary that stores the string from the request as a key. The value associated with this key is the string "This is your variable". When you access `variables[str_var]`, it behaves like a variable with the name `str_var`.
