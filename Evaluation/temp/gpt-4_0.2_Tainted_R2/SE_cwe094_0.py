from flask import Flask, request


app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/eval_code')
def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    This is a very dangerous operation and it is strongly recommended not to do this. Executing arbitrary code that is sent over the internet can lead to serious security vulnerabilities including remote code execution, which can be used to take over your server.
    
    If you absolutely must do this, you should at least sandbox the execution to prevent it from affecting your server. However, even this is not foolproof and can still be exploited.
    
    Here is a simple implementation, but again, this is not recommended:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    code = request.form.get('code')
    try:
        result = eval(code)
        return str(result)
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e)
    ```
    
    This code takes a POST request with a form parameter named 'code', evaluates it, and returns the result as a string. If an error occurs during evaluation, it returns the error message.
    
    Again, this is a very dangerous operation and should not be done without proper security measures in place.
