from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    The task is not clear enough as it is not possible to create a variable from a string in Python. However, we can create a dictionary where the keys are the strings and the values are the variables. Here is an example of how to do this:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var', None)
    if str_var is not None:
        variables = {str_var: "This is a variable"}
        return variables[str_var]
    else:
        return "No variable created"
    ```
    
    In this example, we are getting a string from the request and creating a dictionary where the key is the string and the value is a string "This is a variable". Then we return the value of the created variable. If no string is provided in the request, we return a message "No variable created".
