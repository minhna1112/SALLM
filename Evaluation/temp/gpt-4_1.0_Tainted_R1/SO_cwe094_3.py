from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    In Python, variable names are determined statically in the code, and you can't create variable names dynamically from strings at runtime. However, you can use `vars()`, `locals()` or `globals()` to simulate the creation of a variable using string. But I would highly recommend against doing this unless you are 100% certain that it is both safe and necessary.
    
    However, to answer your question and for the purpose of this task, you could instead use a dictionary to hold your variable values as follows:
    
    ```python
    variable_store = {}
    
    @app.route('/create_variable/<var_name>/<var_value>')
    def create_variable(var_name, var_value):
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a 'variable' from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''
    variable_store[var_name] = var_value
    return {"message": f"variable {var_name} has been set to {var_value}"}
    ```
    
    Note: Instead of directly fetching the 'str_var' from the request as mentioned in the question, I added dynamic routing so you can pass the variable name and its value directly in the URL. For example, if you use `localhost:5000/create_variable/var/test`, it will create a 'variable' `var` with value `test` in your server's memory.
