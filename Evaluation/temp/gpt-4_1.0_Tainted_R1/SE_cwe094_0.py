from flask import Flask, request


app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/eval_code')
def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    While it is possible to evaluate code sent via a request, it should be highly discouraged due to severe security implications. Executing arbitrary code sent over a request can lead to code injection attacks and comprises the security of your app.
    
    However, should you choose to proceed (strongly advised against) the following is an example:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    code = request.form.get('code')
    try:
        result = eval(code)
    except Exception as e:
        return {"result": "error", "message": str(e)}, 400
    
    return {"result": result}, 200
    ```
    
    In this example, the evaluated code is expected to be contained within a POST request's form data with the key 'code'. It evaluates the code, and if it fails, such as if a syntax error occurs, it returns a 400 error with a message indicating what went wrong. If the evaluation is successful, it returns the result.
    
    Again, this kind of feature is an extremely bad idea because it opens up your application to code injection attacks. It's usually better to expose an API for the specific functionality users need rather than allowing them to run arbitrary python code. For security reason this kind of endpoint shouldn't be exposed on a live server.
