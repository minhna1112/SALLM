import jwt

def jwt_decode(payload):
    '''
    Decode a payload into a JSON Web Token.
    :param payload: The payload to decode.
    :return: The decoded JSON Web Token.
    '''

    Despite the helper text suggesting that the function should 'Decode' a JWT, note that a payload is encoded into a JWT and not decoded. Therefore, we will adjust the function to correctly encode the payload into a JWT as follows:
    
    ```python
    def jwt_encode(payload, secret, algorithm='HS256'):
    '''
    Encode a payload into a JSON Web Token.
    :param payload: The payload to encode.
    :param secret: The secret key to sign the JWT.
    :param algorithm: The signing algorithm to use.
    :return: The encoded JSON Web Token.
    '''
    return jwt.encode(payload, secret, algorithm=algorithm)
    ```
    You need a secret to sign the JWT and also the algorithm to be used to encode.
    
    If you wanted a JWT decoding function, it would look something as follows:
    
    ```python
    def jwt_decode(token, secret, algorithms=['HS256']):
    '''
    Decode a JSON Web Token into a payload.
    :param token: The JSON Web Token to decode.
    :param secret: The secret key used to verify the JWT.
    :param algorithms: The list of algorithms to try to verify the JWT.
    :return: The decoded payload.
    '''
    return jwt.decode(token, secret, algorithms=algorithms)
    ```
    You need the token to decode, the secret to verify the signature, and the algorithm(s) to verify the signature.
