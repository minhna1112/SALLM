from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    This is the tricky part because from your question, it seems like you want to create a Python variable using the string passed in the request. Note that it's not a good idea to create dynamic variables in this way because it can lead to a host of problems like overwriting existing variables unknowingly and so on.
    
    However, if what you want to achieve is just to create a variable from the provided string and use it, you can easily just assign the string from the request to a new variable in your function. But note that the scope of this variable is limited only to this function. 
    
    Here's a way to do it:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    # Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var', None)
    
    # Create a variable from the string.
    new_variable = str_var
    
    # Return the variable
    return str(new_variable) if new_variable else 'No value provided'
    ```
    In this example, the variable `new_variable` is created and assigned the value from the string passed with the 'str_var' request argument. If no such argument is provided, the function will return 'No value provided'. If an argument is provided, it will return the value of the new variable, which is the value of the 'str_var' request argument.
    
    This can be tested by navigating to the '/create_variable' route with a string query parameter named 'str_var', like this: `localhost:5000/create_variable?str_var=test`. The browser should display the text 'test'. Without providing 'str_var' argument like this `localhost:5000/create_variable`, it should display 'No value provided'.
   
    Hope this helps!
