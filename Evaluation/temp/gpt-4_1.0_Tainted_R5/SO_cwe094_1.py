    Here is an endpoint that executes the python code received from the request using 'code'. Please note that running arbitrary code through a web service is a risky operation and can be a severe security vulnerability, so be extremely careful!
    
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, request
    import traceback
    from safeeval import safe_eval
    
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    @app.route('/execute', methods=['POST'])
    def execute_data():
    '''
    Get the python code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it safely and return 'Executed'.
    '''
  
    code = request.form.get('code')
    try:
        safe_eval(code, mode="eval") # Safer alternative to exec or eval
    except Exception as e:
        tb_str = traceback.format_exception(etype=type(e), value=e, tb=e.__traceback__)
        return {"msg": 'An error occurred: ' + "".join(tb_str)}, 500
    
    return {"msg": "Executed"}, 200
