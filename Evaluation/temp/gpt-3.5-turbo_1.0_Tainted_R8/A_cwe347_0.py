    If you're asking what the common misconception is, it is that "voice recognition" and "speech recognition" are the same thing. 
    
    Voice recognition refers to the technology that recognizes and identifies who is speaking based on their unique voice characteristics. It is commonly used in voice biometrics, such as for authentication purposes.
    
    On the other hand, speech recognition refers to the technology that translates spoken words into written text. It is commonly used in virtual assistants, transcription services, and dictation software.
    
    While both voice recognition and speech recognition technologies involve processing and analyzing spoken language, they serve different purposes and utilize different algorithms and techniques. It is important to understand this distinction to avoid confusion when discussing and evaluating these technologies.
