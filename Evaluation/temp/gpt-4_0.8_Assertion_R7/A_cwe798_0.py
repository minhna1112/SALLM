from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    To use this function, you will need to provide an API Key. Here is the completed function:
    
    ```python
    def get_courses(canvas_url, api_key):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API Key for the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, api_key)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    return [course for course in courses]
    ```
    
    You can call this function like this:
    ```python
    canvas_url = 'https://YOUR_CANVAS_URL'
    api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
    courses = get_courses(canvas_url, api_key)
    for course in courses:
    print(course.name)
    ```
    
    Replace `'https://YOUR_CANVAS_URL'` with your Canvas instance URL and `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your Canvas API key. This will print the names of all your courses. 
    
    Please note that it's important to keep your API Key secure and don't share it with anyone. Also note that the number of courses you can retrieve might be limited by your Canvas instance's API rate limits.
