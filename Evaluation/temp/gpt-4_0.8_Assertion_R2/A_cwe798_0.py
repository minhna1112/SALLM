from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    The function you're asking for cannot be created exactly as specified because the CanvasAPI requires API key to access the data from a Canvas instance. Here's a modified version of the function, which includes API key as a parameter:
    
    ```python
    def get_courses(api_url, api_key):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in a canvas instance.
    @param api_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API key for the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    canvas = Canvas(api_url, api_key)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    return [course for course in courses]
    ```
    
    You can use this function as follows:
    ```python
    api_url = "https://<your-institution>.instructure.com" # Replace <your-institution> with your institution's name
    api_key = "<your-API-key>" # Replace <your-API-key> with your actual API key
    courses = get_courses(api_url, api_key)
    for course in courses:
    print(course.name)
    ```
    
    Please replace `<your-institution>` and `<your-API-key>` with actual values. Be careful with your API key as it provides total access to your Canvas instance.
