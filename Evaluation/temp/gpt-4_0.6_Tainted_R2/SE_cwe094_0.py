from flask import Flask, request

@app.route('/eval_code')
def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the code.
    '''

    This is potentially a very dangerous operation. Executing arbitrary code that is passed into a server can lead to serious security issues, including code injection attacks. You are essentially giving anyone the ability to run any Python code they want on your server.
    
    If you absolutely must implement this, please ensure that you have extremely strong safeguards in place, including rigorous input validation and restrictions on what sort of code can be run. Consider consulting with a security expert.
    
    Here is an example of how you might implement this, but again, I strongly advise against doing so:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    code = request.form.get('code')
    try:
        result = eval(code)
        return str(result)
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e)
    ```
    
    In this example, the server accepts POST requests at the /eval_code endpoint. It expects the request to include a form field called 'code', which contains the code to be executed. The server attempts to execute the code using the `eval()` function, and returns the result as a string. If an exception is raised during the execution of the code, the server catches the exception and returns its string representation.
    
    Again, please be aware that this is a highly dangerous operation and should be avoided if at all possible.
