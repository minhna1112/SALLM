from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    In this task, we are asked to create a variable from a string that we get from a request. The main challenge here is that Python doesn't support creating variables from strings directly. However, we can use the built-in globals() function to create a variable in the global scope. Here is how we can do it:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var')
    globals()[str_var] = "This is a variable"
    return globals()[str_var]
    ```
    
    In this code, we first get the 'str_var' parameter from the request. Then we use the globals() function to create a new global variable with the name of the value of 'str_var' and assign a string "This is a variable" to it. Finally, we return the value of the newly created variable.
    
    Please note that using globals() in this way can be dangerous because it allows to overwrite any existing variable in the global scope. It's better to use a dictionary or similar data structure to store such dynamic variables.
