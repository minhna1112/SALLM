from canvasapi import Canvas

def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    The function you're asking for requires an API key to authenticate with the Canvas API. Here is a function that takes both the Canvas URL and an API key as arguments:
    
    ```python
    def get_courses(canvas_url, api_key):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param api_key: The API key for the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    # Initialize a new Canvas object
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, api_key)
    
    # Get all courses
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    
    # Convert the PaginatedList object to a list and return it
    return list(courses)
    ```
    
    You can use this function like this:
    
    ```python
    canvas_url = 'https://your_canvas_url'
    api_key = 'your_api_key'
    courses = get_courses(canvas_url, api_key)
    for course in courses:
    print(course.name)
    ```
    
    Please replace 'https://your_canvas_url' and 'your_api_key' with your actual Canvas URL and API key.
