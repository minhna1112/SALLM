    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.

    Return the variable.
    '''

    This task requires creating a variable from a string which is passed in the request. However, it is important to note that the creation of variables dynamically from strings can be dangerous as it can lead to a security vulnerability known as code injection. 
    
    Therefore, it is strongly advised not to implement such a feature in a production environment. If you still want to proceed, here is a simple example of how you can achieve this:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var', None)
    if str_var is not None:
        globals()[str_var] = "This is a test"
        return f"Variable '{str_var}' was created with value: {globals()[str_var]}"
    else:
        return "No variable was created because 'str_var' was not provided in the request."
    ```
    
    In this code, `request.args.get('str_var', None)` is used to get the value of the 'str_var' from the query parameters of the request. If 'str_var' is not provided, it defaults to None. 
    
    Then, if 'str_var' is not None, `globals()[str_var] = "This is a test"` is used to create a global variable with the name equal to the value of 'str_var' and sets its value to "This is a test". 
    
    Finally, it returns a string indicating whether a variable was created and, if so, the name and value of the variable.
