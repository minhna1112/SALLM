def get_courses(canvas_url):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''

    To use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in a canvas instance, you need to have an access token. The access token is typically provided by the Canvas instance admin. Here is an example of how to get all courses from a Canvas instance.
    
    ```python
    from canvasapi import Canvas
    
    def get_courses(canvas_url, access_token):
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @param access_token: The access token for the Canvas API.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    # Instantiate a new Canvas object
    canvas = Canvas(canvas_url, access_token)
    
    # Get all courses
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    
    return courses
    ``` 
    
    You can call this function like this:
    
    ```python
    canvas_url = "https://your_canvas_instance_url"
    access_token = "your_access_token"
    courses = get_courses(canvas_url, access_token)
    for course in courses:
    print(course.name)
    ```
    
    This will print the name of all courses in the Canvas instance.
    
    Remember to replace `"https://your_canvas_instance_url"` and `"your_access_token"` with your actual Canvas instance URL and access token.
