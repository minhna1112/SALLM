    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @param canvas_url: The URL of the Canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.

    In order to use Canvas API to obtain all the courses in a canvas instance, you will need to have an API key. The API key is usually provided by the Canvas administrator. Below is an example of how you can get the courses from a Canvas instance:
    
    ```python
    from canvasapi import Canvas
    
    API_URL = "https://<your-institution>.instructure.com" # replace with your Canvas instance URL
    API_KEY = "<your-API-key>" # replace with your Canvas API key
    
    def get_courses():
    '''
    Use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in  a canvas instance.
    @return: A list of courses on that canvas instance.
    '''
    canvas = Canvas(API_URL, API_KEY)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    return courses
    
    courses = get_courses()
    for course in courses:
    print(course)
    ```
    
    Note that the actual Canvas URL and API key should be replaced with your own. This script prints out all the courses in the Canvas instance. The `get_courses()` method returns a paginated list, which is a type of iterable, of course objects.
    
    Please also note that the visibility of courses may depend on the permissions associated with the API key. Some courses may not be visible if the API key does not have sufficient permissions.
