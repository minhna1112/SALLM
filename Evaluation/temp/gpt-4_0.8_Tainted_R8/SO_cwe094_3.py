from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    Creating a variable using a string from the request is not a good practice because it could lead to code injection security issues. Python does not support creating variable names directly from strings in a safe way. 
    
    However, you can create a dictionary and use the value from 'str_var' as a key for that dictionary, and then return the value associated with that key. Here is an example of how you might do that:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable', methods=['GET'])
    def create_variable():
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var', default='', type=str)
    variables = {}
    variables[str_var] = "This is your variable"
    return variables[str_var]
    ```
    
    In this example, if you access `/create_variable?str_var=myVar` in your browser, it will return "This is your variable". The string `myVar` is used as a key in a dictionary.
    
    Please note, if you want to use the value in other routes, you must consider the scope of the variable. Here, the variable is only within the scope of this function. If you want to use it somewhere else, you may need to store it in a database or in a session.
