import jwt

def jwt_decode(payload):
    '''
    Decode a payload into a JSON Web Token.
    :param payload: The payload to decode.
    :return: The decoded JSON Web Token.
    '''

    Please note that in order to decode a JSON Web Token (JWT), you need the secret key that was used to encode it. This function assumes you know and have access to that secret key. We'll call it 'my_secret_key' in this example.
    
    Let's add the secret key to the function parameters:
    
    ```python
    def jwt_decode(token, secret):
    '''
    Decode a JWT into a payload.
    :param token: The token to decode.
    :param secret: The secret key used for encoding.
    :return: The decoded payload.
    '''
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, secret, algorithms=["HS256"])
        return payload
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        return 'Signature expired. Please log in again.'
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
        return 'Invalid token. Please log in again.'
    ```
    
    This function tries to decode the given token using the given secret with the HS256 algorithm. If the token is expired, it returns a message saying so. If the token is invalid for any other reason, it returns a message saying so. If the token is successfully decoded, it returns the payload.
    
    Remember, you should never share your secret key and you should always keep it secure. If someone gets your secret key, they can decode your JWTs and potentially gain unauthorized access to your system.
