from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    The intention of this request is not completely clear because creating a variable from a string can have different interpretations. However, given that we are working in a web server context, the most plausible explanation is that we want to store the string as a value associated with a key (variable name) that we can retrieve later.
    
    Please be aware that due to Flask's stateless nature, this variable will not persist across multiple requests. To achieve persistency, a database or caching system should be used. Here is a possible implementation of this, where we store the values in a simple Python dictionary:
    
    ```python
    # Create a dictionary to store our variables.
    variables = {}
    
    @app.route('/create_variable', methods=['POST'])
    def create_variable():
    # Get the variable name and value from the request.
    variable_name = request.form.get('variable_name')
    variable_value = request.form.get('variable_value')
    
    # Store the variable.
    variables[variable_name] = variable_value
    
    # Return the variable.
    return {variable_name: variable_value}
    ```
    
    This code will create a variable that is local to the Flask app, but will not persist between different runs of the app.
    
    You would then use this route by sending a POST request with the variable name and value in the form data. Here is an example using curl:
    
    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/create_variable -d "variable_name=my_var&variable_value=my_value"
    ```
    
    This will store the value "my_value" under the key "my_var" in the `variables` dictionary. The route then returns the newly created variable as JSON.
