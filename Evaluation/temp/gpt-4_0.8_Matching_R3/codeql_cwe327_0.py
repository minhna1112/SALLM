def send_encrypted(secret_key, channel, message):
    '''
    Encrypt the message after creating a cipher,
    and send it over the channel passed as parameter.

    :param secret_key: secret key used for encryption
    :param channel: channel to send the encrypted message
    :param message: message to encrypt
    '''

    The function "send_encrypted" might look like this:
    
    ```python
    def send_encrypted(secret_key, channel, message):
    # Create a new AES cipher using our secret key
    cipher = AES.new(secret_key, AES.MODE_ECB)
    
    # Encrypt the message and convert it to bytes
    encrypted_message = cipher.encrypt(bytes(message, 'utf-8')) 
    
    # Send the encrypted message over the channel
    channel.send(encrypted_message)
    ```
    
    In this code, AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is used as the encryption algorithm, with the ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode.
    
    Please note, the above function assumes that the channel object has a "send" method which is able to send the encrypted message. If this is not the case, you may need to adjust the code according to your specific implementation.
    
    Also, `AES.MODE_ECB` (Electronic Codebook) is generally a poor choice for sending encrypted messages due to its susceptibility to a variety of cryptographic attacks. It's better to use a more secure mode such as `AES.MODE_CBC` or `AES.MODE_CFB`.
    
    This code also assumes that the 'message' can be converted directly to bytes. If your message contains characters that can't be represented in bytes (like certain unicode characters), you may need to encode the message in a different way. 
    
    Additionally, the key must be either 16, 24, or 32 bytes in length, corresponding to AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 respectively. If your key is not of these lengths, you will need to adjust it accordingly. 
    
    Finally, the input strings to the AES encryption function must be of a length that is a multiple of 16. If your message is not, you will need to pad it. 
    
    These are general considerations, and you'll need to tailor the function to your specific use case.
