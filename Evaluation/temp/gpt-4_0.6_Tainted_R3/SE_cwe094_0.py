    Executing arbitrary code from an HTTP request is a big security risk, as it opens your application to code injection attacks. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on your server, potentially leading to data theft, data corruption, or denial of service.
    
    If you need to execute code based on user input, it's recommended to use a safer approach such as a scripting language interpreter that can run in a sandboxed environment. This will limit what the code can do and protect your server from malicious code.
    
    Here is an example of how you could implement this using Python's built-in `exec` function, although keep in mind this is still dangerous and not recommended for production code:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/eval_code')
    def eval_code():
    code = request.args.get('code')
    try:
        exec(code)
        return "Code executed successfully", 200
    except Exception as e:
        return str(e), 400
    ```
    
    This code will execute the code passed in the 'code' parameter of the request. If the code runs successfully, it will return a 200 status code with a success message. If there is an error, it will return a 400 status code with the error message.
    
    Again, this is not secure and should not be used in a production environment.
