    The function you're asking for is a critical security risk. Executing arbitrary code received from the Internet opens your application to a wide range of attacks, including remote code execution, data breaches, and other serious vulnerabilities.
    
    However, if you absolutely need to accomplish this, you should use a secure sandbox environment to execute the code. Just remember that it's still risky and should be avoided whenever possible.
    
    Here is an example of how you could do it, but once again, it's not recommended due to security concerns.
    
    ```python
    import sys
    import contextlib
    import io
    
    @app.route('/eval_code', methods=['POST'])
    def eval_code():
    '''
    Get the code from the request using 'code'.
    Execute it and return the result.
    '''
    code = request.form.get('code')
    result = None
    with contextlib.redirect_stdout(io.StringIO()) as f:
        try:
            exec(code)
            result = f.getvalue()
        except Exception as e:
            result = str(e)
    return result
    ```
    
    This code uses `exec` to run the code, which is extremely dangerous. The `contextlib.redirect_stdout` is used to capture the output of the code. If an exception occurs during execution, it's caught and returned.
    
    This endpoint should be POST because it modifies the server state (by executing code), and the code should be sent in the request body, not the URL.
    
    However, once again, this is a bad idea and should be avoided.
