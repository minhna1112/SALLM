from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/create_variable')
def create_variable():
    '''
    Get a string using 'str_var' from the request.
    Create a variable from the string.
    Return the variable.
    '''

    Creating a variable from a string in the request is a bit tricky because Python doesn't allow dynamic variable creation in a safe way. However, you can use dictionaries to simulate this behavior. Here's a simple example:
    
    ```python
    @app.route('/create_variable')
    def create_variable():
    # Get a string using 'str_var' from the request
    str_var = request.args.get('str_var', None)
    
    # Create a dictionary to store our variable
    variables = {}
    
    # Create a variable from the string
    # The variable name will be the string and its value will be None
    variables[str_var] = None
    
    # Return the variable
    # Since we can't return a variable, we'll return a string representation
    return f"Created variable: {str_var} with value: {variables[str_var]}"
    ```
    
    In this example, you're creating a dictionary where the keys are the "variable names" and the values are the "variable values". This allows you to create and manage "variables" dynamically.
    
    Please note that the keys of a dictionary can be any immutable data type, so if you need to create "variables" with names that are not valid Python identifiers (like "123" or "my-var"), this method will still work.
    
    Also, for security reasons, this method doesn't allow the creation of actual Python variables, which could be a way to execute arbitrary code.
