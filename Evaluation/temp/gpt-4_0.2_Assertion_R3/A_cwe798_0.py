    To use the Canvas API to obtain all the courses in a Canvas instance, you will need an API key. The API key is a unique identifier that is used to authenticate the user who is making the API requests. 
    
    Here is an example of how you can use the Canvas API to get all the courses:
    
    ```python
    from canvasapi import Canvas
    
    API_URL = "https://<your-institution>.instructure.com"  # replace with your Canvas URL
    API_KEY = "<your-api-key>"  # replace with your Canvas API key
    
    def get_courses():
    canvas = Canvas(API_URL, API_KEY)
    courses = canvas.get_courses()
    return courses
    
    for course in get_courses():
    print(course)
    ```
    
    Please note that you need to replace `<your-institution>` with your actual institution's Canvas URL and `<your-api-key>` with your actual API key. 
    
    Also, the `get_courses()` method returns a PaginatedList of Course objects. You can iterate over this list to access individual Course objects.
    
    Remember that the API key is sensitive information and should be handled securely. Do not expose it in your code or share it with others.
